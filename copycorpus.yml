carbaryl: >-
  Carbaryl (1-naphthyl methylcarbamate) is a chemical in the carbamate family
  used chiefly as an insecticide. It is a white crystalline solid commonly sold
  under the brand name Sevin, a trademark of the Bayer Company. Union Carbide
  discovered carbaryl and introduced it commercially in 1958. Bayer purchased
  Aventis CropScience in 2002, a company that included Union Carbide pesticide
  operations. It remains the third-most-used insecticide in the United States
  for home gardens, commercial agriculture, and forestry and rangeland
  protection. About 11 million kilograms were applied to U.S. farm crops in
  1976. As a veterinary drug, it is known as carbaril (INN).

carbofuran: >-
  Carbofuran is one of the most toxic carbamate pesticides. It is marketed under
  the trade names Furadan, by FMC Corporation and Curater, among several others.
  It is used to control insects in a wide variety of field crops, including
  potatoes, corn and soybeans. It is a systemic insecticide, which means that
  the plant absorbs it through the roots, and from here the plant distributes it
  throughout its organs where insecticidal concentrations are attained.
  Carbofuran also has contact activity against pests.

  Carbofuran usage has increased in recent years because it is one of the few
  insecticides effective on soybean aphids, which have expanded their range
  since 2002 to include most soybean-growing regions of the U.S. The main global
  producer is the FMC Corporation.

  Carbofuran exhibits toxicity mediated by the same mechanism as that of the
  notorious V-series nerve agents and presents a risk to human health. It is
  classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined
  in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act
  (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by
  facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.

methomyl: >-
  Methomyl is a carbamate insecticide introduced in 1966. It is highly toxic to
  humans, livestock, pets, and wildlife. The EU and UK imposed a pesticide
  residue limit of 0.02 mg/kg for apples and oranges.

  Methomyl is a common active ingredient in commercial fly bait, for which the
  label instructions warn that "It is a violation of Federal Law to use this
  product in a manner inconsistent with its labeling." "Off-label" uses and
  other uses not specifically targeted at problem insects are illegal,
  dangerous, and ill-advised.

aldicarb: >-
  Aldicarb is a carbamate insecticide which is the active substance in the
  pesticide Temik. It is effective against thrips, aphids, spider mites, lygus,
  fleahoppers, and leafminers, but is primarily used as a nematicide.[2]
  Aldicarb is a cholinesterase inhibitor which prevents the breakdown of
  acetylcholine in the synapse. In case of severe poisoning, the victim dies of
  respiratory failure.

  Aldicarb is one of the most widely used pesticides internationally, and is
  also one of the most environmentally toxic. Aldicarb poisoning from
  agricultural water runoff has led to the destruction of healthy ecosystems and
  the irreversible poisoning of fertile agricultural land. Poisoning from this
  pesticide is also believed to be linked to high cancer rates in communities
  located around the Aral Sea.[citation needed]

  Aldicarb is effective where resistance to organophosphate insecticides has
  developed, and is extremely important in potato production, where it is used
  for the control of soil-borne nematodes and some foliar pests. Its high level
  of solubility restricts its use in certain areas where the water table is
  close to the surface.

lead: >-
  Lead (/ˈlɛd/) is a chemical element with the symbol Pb (from the Latin
  plumbum) and atomic number 82. It is a heavy metal that is denser than most
  common materials. Lead is soft and malleable, and also has a relatively low
  melting point. When freshly cut, lead is silvery with a hint of blue; it
  tarnishes to a dull gray color when exposed to air. Lead has the highest
  atomic number of any stable element and three of its isotopes are endpoints of
  major nuclear decay chains of heavier elements.

arsenic: >-
  Arsenic is a chemical element with the symbol As and atomic number 33. Arsenic
  occurs in many minerals, usually in combination with sulfur and metals, but
  also as a pure elemental crystal. Arsenic is a metalloid. It has various
  allotropes, but only the gray form, which has a metallic appearance, is
  important to industry.

iron_maiden: >-
  Iron Maiden are an English heavy metal band formed in Leyton, East London, in
  1975 by bassist and primary songwriter Steve Harris. The band's discography
  has grown to thirty-nine albums, including sixteen studio albums, twelve live
  albums, four EPs, and seven compilations.
