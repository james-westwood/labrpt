# Example of results from lab for a single food product.
#
# Any line starting with "#" is ignored as a comment.
# Note that if you have comment lines Excel may not like it.
# The first line fields are titles, which must match the corresponding entries
# in the copy corpus and the database of chemical information.
#
# Each data line corresponds to the measured result of a single sample.
# Therefore, averaging calculations are over columns, not rows.
# sampleId matches the regex r'\W+' so no spaces.
# Every other field is a real decimal number.
#
# This kind of CSV format with an ID column can be expressed as Map.
# Also known as dictionary, assocative array, hashmap.
